# AC-LED

A KiCad schematic and PCB design for a circuit to power a Cree CXA1507 36 volt COB LED directly from a 240 volts AC supply. The 36 volt variant of the CXA1507 draws 200 mA, so this design would work with any LED unit that draws this current. 

## Warning 

**Use this design at your own risk!** Working with high voltage AC is _extremely_ dangerous, and may even be illegal in some areas if not authorised. I make absolutely no guarantee of safety or fitness for purpose of this design.
